 *
 * The output buffer for synthetic division should have size degree1+1 (e.g
 * it is the same size as poly1). The beginning is the result and the tail
 * is the remainder. If it exists, the degree of the remainder tail is
 * (d-degree1-1) where d is the result degree. This value must be broken
 * up to implement the / and % operators. However, some algorithms (like
 * Bairstow's method) prefer this method just the way it is.
 *
 * If poly1 and poly2 are standardized (i.e. the highest coefficient is
 * nonzero), then the result is guaranteed to be standardized, but the
 * remainder may not be. The function does not standardize the result if
 * either poly1 or poly2 are not standardized. Furthermore, this function
 * will fail if the leading coefficient of poly2 is zero, even if it is not
 * not the zero polynomial. If you want a form of division that works on
 * non-standardized polynomials, use {@link ATK_PolyDiv} and
 * {@link ATK_PolyRem}.
 *
 * The implementation of the algorithm ensures that it is safe for the
