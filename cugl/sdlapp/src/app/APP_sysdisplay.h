 * This library is built on the assumption that an application built for SDL
 * will contain its own versions of the SDL libraries (either statically linked
 * or packaged with a specific set of dynamic libraries).  While this is not
 * considered the right way to do it on Unix, it makes one step installation
 * easier for Mac and Windows. It is also the only way to create SDL apps for
 * mobile devices.
