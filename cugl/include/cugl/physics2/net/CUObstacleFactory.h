 * send texture and body information.
 *
 * In order for every client to be updated when a new obstacle is created, they
 * must have a uniform way to share info about the obstacle to be created. However,
 * syncing the texture and body data is very costly, so this class is a template
 * for creating an obstacle and (optionally) a scene node from serialized parameters.
