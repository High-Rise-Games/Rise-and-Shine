//
//  This module provides a network controller for multiplayer physics based
//  game.  It is an extension of the networking tools in cugl::net. It is
//  built around an event-based system that fully encapsulates the network
//  connection. Events across the network are automatically serialized and
//  deserialized.
//
//  The class for a general network controller for multiplayer physics based game.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer

 * of the original network controller. It is built around an event-based system
 * that fully encapsulates the network connection. Events across the network
 * are automatically serialized and deserialized.
 *
 * Connection to to the lobby is provided by the methods {@link #connectAsHost}
 * and {@link #connectAsClient}. When starting a game, the host locks the lobby
 * and calls {@link startGame()} to initiate a handshake. The host then
 * distributes a shortUID to all players (including the host), and players
 * respond by calling {@link #markReady} after they receive the shortUID and
 * finish their initialization. When host receives responses from all players,
 * the game will officially start and {@link #getStatus} will return INGAME.
 *
 * Physics synchronization is an optional feature, and is enabled by calling
 * {@link #enablePhysics}. Upon enabling physics, a dedicated controller is
 * created to handle physics synchronization. For fine-tuning and more info,
 * see {@link NetPhysicsController}.
 *
 * There are three built-in event types: {@link GameStateEvent},
 * {@link PhysSyncEvent}, and {@link PhysObstEvent}. See the {@link NetEvent}
 * class and {@link #attachEventType} for how to add and setup custom events.
