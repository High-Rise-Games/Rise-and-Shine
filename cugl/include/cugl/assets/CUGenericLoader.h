//
//  CUGenericLoader.h
//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  This module provides an abstract class for loading generic assets (such
//  as a model file or level layout) not explicitly included in the existing
//  asset classes. It is fairly experimental, so use at your own risk. If there
//  are certain assets that we overlooked that are the same across all projects,
//  we will consider adding them to the engine at a later date.
//
//  This module is meant to be used in conjunction with the Asset class which
//  provides support for loading the asset.  As such, this class really just
//  functions as an asset manager.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.
