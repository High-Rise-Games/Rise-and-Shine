//  This module provides a generalization of CULog that (1) creates multiple
//  channels to potentially log to and (2) simultaneously logs to a file and
//  to the output terminal. File logging is particularly useful for longer
//  running games.
//
//  This class is a singleton and should never be allocated directly.  It

/**
 * This class provides an interface for fine-grained logging.
 *
 * This class is an alternative to `CULog` that provides a lot more features.
 * First of all it provides multiple log channels, each with its own settings.
 * In addition, each channel has its own associated log file. This allows you
 * to keep separate logs for the purposes of analysis and debugging.
 *
 * Logs are written to the save directory {@link Application#getSaveDirectory}.
 * They are named `<channel>.log` where `<channel>` is the name of the log
 * channel. Each line of the log file is prefixed by the time up to the nearest
 * microsecond. Messages are only written to the file if they have a log level
 * less than or equal to log level of the channel.
 *
 * It is possible to log to a file and the output console (e.g. the output
 * stream for CULog) at the same time. The console has its own log level
 * (defined as {@link #getConsoleLevel}) and will process messages accordingly.
 * Note that the console uses its own timestamps, and so there will be a few
 * microseconds difference between the log file and the console.
