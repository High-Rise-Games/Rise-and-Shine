/**
 * An enum to support stenciling effects.
 *
 * A {@link SpriteBatch} can support many types of stencil effects. Classic
 * stencil effects including clipping (limiting drawing to a specific region)
 * or masking (prohibiting drawing to a specific region). The stencil effects
 * supported are designed with {@link scene2::CanvasNode} in mind as the primary
 * use case.
 *
 * In particular, stencil effects are designed to support simple constructive
 * area geometry operations. You can union, intersect, or subtract stencil
 * regions to produce the relevant effects. However, this is only used for
 * drawing and does not actually construct the associated geometries.
 *
 * To support the CAG operations, the sprite batch stencil buffer has two
 * areas: low and high. Operations can be applied to one or both of these
 * regions. All binary operations are operations between these two regions.
 * For example, {@link StencilEffect#CLIP_MASK} will restrict all drawing to 
 * the stencil region defined in the low buffer, while also prohibiting any 
 * drawing to the stencil region in the high buffer. This has the visible effect 
 * of "subtracting" the high buffer from the low buffer.
 *
 * The CAG operations are only supported at the binary level, as we only have
 * two halves of the stencil buffer. However, using non-drawing effects like
 * {@link StencilEffect#CLIP_WIPE} or {@link StencilEffect#CLIP_CARVE}, it is 
 * possible to produce more interesting nested expressions.
 *
 * Note that when using split-buffer operations, only one of the operations
 * will modify the stencil buffer. That is why there no effects such as
 * `FILL_WIPE` or `CLAMP_STAMP`.
