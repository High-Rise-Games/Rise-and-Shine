//
//  A glyph run is a mesh for a specific font atlas. In order to scalably
//  support unicode, fonts often have mutliple atlases, each composed of a
//  disjoint set of glyphs. When we render a string of text, we break it
//  up into multiple glyph runs, one for each relevant atlas. This allows
//  for efficient rendering of the text with minimal texture switching.
//
//  This class is essentially a struct with some shared pointer support.
//  We make all of the fields publicly accessible. We have a static constuctor
//  with a shared pointer, to be consistent with other CUGL classes.
//  However, we do not have an init method, since the default values of
//  the fields are acceptable.
