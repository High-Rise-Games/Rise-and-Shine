//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  This module is used to solve two problems. First, it allows us to finally
//  support multi-line text, which was missing in earlier versions of CUGL
//  (and has been one of the most requested features). More importantly, it
//  allows us to decouple text formatting from the Label class. Because of
//  this class we can draw text directly to a sprite batch without having to
//  use the scene graph API.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.

/**
 * This class manages the layout of (potentially) multiple lines of text.
 *
 * The purpose of this class is to decouple text layout from the {@link scene2::Label}
 * scene graph class, so we can draw text directly to a {@link SpriteBatch}.
 * Given a string, it potentially breaks the string up into multiple lines and
 * allows you to control the relative alignment of each line.
 *
 * In addition, a text layout object has an implicit coordinate system with
 * an origin. This origin is defined by the {@link #getHorizontalAlignment}
 * and {@link #getVerticalAlignment} options. This origin is used to place
 * the text when it is rendered with a sprite batch.
 *
 * Changing any of the layout attributes will obviously invalidate the text
 * layout. For performance reasons, we do not automatically recompute the
 * layout in that case. Instead, the user must call {@link #layout} to
 * arrange the text.
 *
 * By default, the text layout will only break lines at newline characters in
 * the string. However, you can perform more agressive line breaking with the
 * optional {@link #getWidth} attribute.  When this attribute is positive, the
 * text layout will break lines so that each line does not exceed this width.
 *
 * Lines will be broken at the last white space character found before exceeding
 * the width. If there is no such whitespace character, it will break the line
 * before the first character exceeding the width. While this class does not
 * support more sophisticated line breaking like hyphenation, the end result is
 * good enough for most in-game multi-line text support.
 *
 * When formatting multiline text, whitespace at the beginning and end of each
 * line will be "swallowed", causing it to be ignored for purposes of alignment.
 * The exception is at the beginning and end of a paragraph.  Whitespace there
 * will be preserved.  A paragraph is defined as any piece of text separated by
 * a newline. So the first part of the string before a newline is a paragraph,
 * and each substring after a newline is also a paragraph.
 *
 * Finally, it is possible to disable all line breaking in a text layout
 * (including newlines). Simply set the width to a negative value.
