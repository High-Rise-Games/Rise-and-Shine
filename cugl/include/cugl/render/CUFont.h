//  CUFont.h
//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  This module provides a robust font asset with atlas support.  As with
//  most font atlas set-ups, a font may spread its characters over multiple
//  atlases. That is to prevent the textures from getting too large.
//
//  This module makes heavy use of the cross-platform UTF8 utilities by
//  Nemanja Trifunovic ( https://github.com/nemtrif/utfcpp ).
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.

 * This class represents a true type font at a fixed size.
 *
 * It is possible to change many of the font settings after loading.  However,
 * the size is fixed and cannot be changed.  If you want a different size of
 * the same font, you must load it as a new asset.
 *
 * This font can be used to generate {@link GlyphRun} sequences for rendering
 * text to the screen. This is typically done via the {@link scene2::Label} class,
 * though the a glyph run contains enough information to be rendered directly
 * with a {@link SpriteBatch}.
 *
 * Rendering ASCII text is easy.  For unicode support however, you need to 
 * encode you text properly. the only unicode encoding that we support is UTF8.  
 * For the reason why, see
 *
 *      http://utf8everywhere.org/#how
 *
 * This font can also support atlases.  This is a texture with all of the
 * selected characters prerendered.  This texture is then used to render the
 * font on screen.  This is a potentially fast way of rendering fonts, as
 * you can simply represent the text as a quad mesh with a single texture.
 *
 * However, afont atlas textures can be huge if all glyphs are included.
 * For example, if we include all the unicode characters in Times New Roman at
 * 48 point font, the resulting atlas texture is 2048x4096, which is too much
 * for mobile devices. As a result, fonts may spread their glyphs across
 * multiple altases to keep the texture size small.
 *
 * In addition, only ASCII characters are included in a font atlas by default.
 * To get unicode characters outside of the ASCII range, you must specify
 * them when you build the atlas.
