//  This module provides one-stop shopping for basic 2d graphics.  Despite the
//  name, it is also capable of drawing solid shapes, as well as wireframes.
//  It also has support for color gradients and (rotational) scissor masks.
//
//  While it is possible to swap out the shader for this class, the shader is
//  very peculiar in how it uses uniforms.  You should study SpriteShader.frag
//  and SpriteShader.vert before making any shader changes to this class.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.

/**
 * This class is a sprite batch for drawing 2d graphics.
 *
 * A sprite batch gathers together sprites and draws them as a single mesh
 * whenever possible. However this sprite batch is different from a classic sprite
 * batch (from XNA or LibGDX) in that it provides a complete 2d graphics pipeline
 * supporting both solid shapes and outlines, with texture, gradient, and scissor
 * mask support.
 *
 * This sprite batch is capable of drawing with an active texture. In that case,
 * the shape will be drawn with a solid color. If no color has been specified, the
 * default color is white. Outlines use the same texturing rules that solids do.
 * There is also support for a simple, limited radius blur effect on textures.
 *
 * Color gradient support is provided by the {@link Gradient} class. All gradients
 * will be tinted by the current color (so the color should be reset to white
 * before using a gradient).
 *
 * Scissor masks are supported by the {@link Scissor} class. This is useful for
 * constraining shapes to an internal window. A scissor mask must be a transformed
 * rectangle; it cannot mask with arbitrary polygons.
 *
 * Drawing only occurs when the methods {@link #flush} or {@link #end} are 
 * called. Because loading vertices into a {@link VertexBuffer} is an expensive 
 * operation, this sprite batch attempts to minimize this as much as possible.
 * Even texture switches are batched.  However, it is still true that using a
 * single texture atlas can significantly improve drawing speed.
 *
 * A review of this class shows that there are a lot of redundant drawing methods.
 * The scene graphs only use the {@link Mesh} methods. This goal has been to make 
 * this class more accessible to students familiar with classic sprite batches 
 * found in LibGDX or XNA.
 *
 * It is possible to swap out the shader for this class with another one.  Any
 * shader for this class should support {@link SpriteVertex2} as its vertex data.
 * If you need additional vertex information, such as normals, you should create
 * a new class.  It should also have a uniform for the perspective matrix,
 * texture, and drawing type (type 0). Support for gradients and scissors occur
 * via a uniform block that is provides the data in the order scissor, and then
 * gradient.  See SpriteShader.frag for more information.
 *
 * This is an extremely heavy-weight class. There is rarely any need to have more
 * than one of these at a time. If you want to implement your own shader effects,
 * it is better to construct your own custom pipeline with {@link Shader} and
 * {@link VertexBuffer}.
