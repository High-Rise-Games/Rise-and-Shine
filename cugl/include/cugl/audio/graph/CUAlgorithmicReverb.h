//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  This module provides an audio node wrapper for the reverb support provided
//  by SDL_atk. That implementation is modeled after the the open source
//  Schroeder reverberator, Freeverb.
//
//  More about the program can be found at:
//  https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Freeverb.html
//
//  Open source code taken from:
//  https://github.com/tim-janik/beast/tree/master/plugins/freeverb
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.
