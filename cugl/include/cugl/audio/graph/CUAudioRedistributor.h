//  CUAudioRedistributor.h
//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  This module provides a graph node for converting from one set of channels
//  to a different set of channels (e.g. mono to stereo or 5.1 down to mono).
//  It is necessary because some devices (notably MSI laptops) will always
//  give you audio devices with 5.1 or 7.1 channels, even when you ask for
//  stereo.
//
//  Historically, this conversion was done with SDL_AudioStream. And unlike
//  resampling, this is a conversion that works properly in SDL_AudioStream.
//  However, because we had to drop SDL_AudioStream for resampling, we decided
//  to drop it entirely.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.

 * This class represents an audio channel redistributor.
 *
 * A channel redistributor is a node whose input number of channels does not
 * match the output number of channels. This is necessary for some latops, where
 * the output sound card requires more than two channels, even though the vast
 * majority of applications are designed for stereo (not surround) sound.
 *
 * A channel redistributor works by using a matrix to redistribute the input
 * channels, in much the same way that a matrix decoder works. However, unlike
 * a matrix decoder, it is possible to use a redistributor to reduce the number
 * of channels (with a matrix whose rows are less that is columns). Furthermore,
 * a redistributor does not support phase shifting.
 *
 * The audio graph should only be accessed in the main thread.  In addition,
 * no methods marked as AUDIO THREAD ONLY should ever be accessed by the user.
 *
 * This class does not support any actions for the {@link AudioNode#setCallback}.
