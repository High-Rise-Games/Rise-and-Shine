//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  An audio decoder converts a binary file into a pageable PCM data stream. It
//  is built on top of our extension to SDL2: SDL_Codec.  This class unifies the
//  API for all of the supported audio codes (WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC)
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.

/**
 * This class represents an audio file decoder.
 *
 * An audio file decoder takes an audio file and converts into a linear-PCM
 * stream. This stream is used by the classes {@link AudioSample} (to read the
 * audio data into memory) and {@link audio::AudioPlayer} (to play an audio
 * stream directly from the file).
 *
 * This decoder supports all the file types in {@link AudioType}, with the
 * exception of {@link AudioType#IN_MEMORY}. The restrictions for the various
 * file types are described in the enumeration for that type.
 *
 * This class ensures that all memory pages are uniform in size. When the
 * page size is variable, this decoder tries to balance memory requirements
 * paging efficiency.
 *
 * The decoder always interleaves the audio channels. MP3 and WAV ADPCM only
 * support mono or stereo. But all other formats can support more channels.
 * SDL supports up to 8 channels (7.1 stereo) in general. Note that the channel
 * layout for OGG data is nonstandard (e.g. channels > 3 are not stereo compatible),
 * so this decoder standardizes the channel layout to agree with FLAC and other
 * data encodings.
 *
 * A decoder is NOT thread safe. If a decoder is used by an audio thread, then
 * it should not be accessed directly in the main thread, and vice versa.
