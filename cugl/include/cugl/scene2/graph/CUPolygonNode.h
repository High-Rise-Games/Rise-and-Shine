//  CUPolygonNode.h
//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  This module provides a scene graph node that supports basic sprite graphics.
//  The sprites do not have to be rectangular. They may be any shape represented
//  by Poly2.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.

/**
 * This is a scene graph node representing a textured solid 2D polygon.
 *
 * The polygon is specified in image coordinates. Image coordinates are different
 * from texture coordinates. Their origin is at the bottom-left corner of the file,
 * and each pixel is one unit. This makes specifying a polygon more natural for
 * irregular shapes.
 *
 * This means that a polygon with vertices (0,0), (width,0), (width,height),
 * and (0,height) would be identical to a sprite node. However, a polygon with
 * vertices (0,0), (2*width,0), (2*width,2*height), and (0,2*height) would tile
 * the sprite (given the wrap settings) twice both horizontally and vertically.
 *
 * The content size of this node is defined by the size (but not the offset)
 * of the bounding box.  The anchor point is relative to this content size.
 * The default anchor point in a TexturedNode is (0.5, 0.5).  This means that a
 * uniform translation of the polygon (in contrast to the node itself) will not
 * move the shape on the the screen.  Instead, it will just change the part of
 * the texture it uses.
 *
 * For example, suppose the texture has given width and height.  We have one
 * polygon with vertices (0,0), (width/2,0), (width/2,height/2), and (0,height/2).
 * We have another polygon with vertices (width/2,height/2), (width,height/2),
 * (width,height), and (width/2,height).  Both polygons would create a rectangle
 * of size (width/2,height/2). centered at the node position.  However, the
 * first would use the bottom left part of the texture, while the second would
 * use the top right.
 *
 * You can disable these features at any time by setting the attribute absolute
 * to true.  Doing this will place the polygon vertices in their absolute positions
 * in Node space. This will also disable anchor functions (setting the anchor as
 * the bottom left corner), since anchors do not make sense when we are drawing
 * vertices directly into the coordinate space.
