//
//  This module provides a scene graph node that supports extruded paths. When
//  extruding paths, this node is better than PolygonNode, because it will align
//  the extruded path to the original wireframe.
//
//  This class uses SimpleExtruder to perform all extrusion. The user provides
//  a path and not a solid polygon.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.

/**
 * This is a scene graph node to represent a path with width.
 *
 * At first glance, it would appear that this class is unnecessary. A path
 * with width, produced by {@link SimpleExtruder}, is a solid polygon.  This
 * polygon can, in turn, be used in conjunction with {@link PolygonNode}.
 *
 * However, there are some subtle issues. In particular, mitres and joints
 * may mean that a PathNode and {@link WireNode} at the same position will
 * not line up with one another. This is undesirable. Hence this is a special
 * polygon node that takes into account that it is an extruded path.
 *
 * One of the side effects of this is that the content size of the node is
 * defined by the path, NOT the extruded polygon.  If you want the bounds of
 * the extruded path (relative to Node space), you should use the method
 * {@link getExtrudedContentBounds()}. Additionally, the anchor point is
 * relative to the content size not the extruded size. This means that the
 * extruded path may be to the left of the origin even when the anchor is
 * at (0,0).
 *
 * Because paths have width, it is natural to texture them. However, generally
 * you will only want to create a path with the degenerate texture (to draw
 * a solid, colored path). Hence, none of the static constructors take a
 * texture. You are free to update the texture after creation, if you wish.
 *
 * The extruded polygon is specified in image coordinates. Image coordinates are
 * different from texture coordinates. Their origin is at the bottom-left corner
 * of the file, and each pixel is one unit. This makes specifying to polygon more
 * natural for irregular shapes.
 *
 * This means that an extrusion with vertices (0,0), (width,0), (width,height),
 * and (0,height) would be identical to a sprite node. However, an extrusion with
 * vertices (0,0), (2*width,0), (2*width,2*height), and (0,2*height) would tile
 * the sprite (given the wrap settings) twice both horizontally and vertically.
 * A uniform translation of the extrusion (in contrast to the node itself) will
 * not move the shape on the the screen.  Instead, it will just change the part
 * or the texture it uses.
 *
 * For example, suppose the texture has given width and height.  We have one
 * extrusion with vertices (0,0), (width/2,0), (width/2,height/2), and (0,height/2).
 * We have another extrusion with vertices (width/2,height/2), (width,height/2),
 * (width,height), and (width/2,height).  Both extrusion would have size
 * (width/2,height/2) and be centered at the node position.  However, the first
 * would use the bottom left part of the texture, while the second would use
 * the top right.
 *
 * You can disable these features at any time by setting the attribute absolute
 * to true.  Do this will place the path vertices in their absolute positions in
 * Node space.  This will also disable anchor functions (setting the anchor as
 * the bottom left corner), since anchors do not make sense when we are drawing
 * vertices directly into the coordinate space.
