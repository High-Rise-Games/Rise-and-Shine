//  You should never instantiate an object of this class.  Instead, you should

/**
 * This class is an abstract scene graph node representing a textured shape.
 *
 * This class cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, you must use one of the
 * subclasses: {@link PolygonNode}, {@link SpriteNode}, {@link PathNode},
 * or {@link WireNode}.
 *
 * This abstract class only manages texture. It has no shape. The shape/mesh
 * of a textured node is determined by the appropriate subclass.  However, for
 * all subclasses, the shape is always specified in image coordinates. Image
 * coordinates are different from texture coordinates. Their origin is at the
 * bottom-left corner of the file, and each pixel is one unit. This design
 * choice is intended to make irregular shapes easier to use.
 *
 * This means that a solid polygon with vertices (0,0), (width,0), (width,height),
 * and (0,height) would be identical to a sprite node. However, a solid polygon
 * with vertices (0,0), (2*width,0), (2*width,2*height), and (0,2*height) would
 * tile the sprite (given the wrap settings) twice both horizontally and vertically.
 *
 * The content size of this node is defined by the size (but not the offset)
 * of the bounding box. The anchor point is relative to this content size.
 * The default anchor point in a TexturedNode is (0.5, 0.5).  This means that
 * a uniform translation of the the underlying shape (in contrast to the node
 * itself) will not move the node on the the screen. Instead, it will just change
 * the part of the texture it uses.
 *
 * For example, suppose the texture has given width and height.  We have one
 * polygon with vertices (0,0), (width/2,0), (width/2,height/2), and (0,height/2).
 * We have another polygon with vertices (width/2,height/2), (width,height/2),
 * (width,height), and (width/2,height).  Both polygons would create a rectangle
 * of size (width/2,height/2). centered at the node position.  However, the
 * first would use the bottom left part of the texture, while the second would
 * use the top right.
 *
 * You can disable these features at any time by setting the attribute
 * absolute to true.  Do this will place the polygon vertices in their
 * absolute positions in Node space.  This will also disable anchor functions
 * (setting the anchor as the bottom left corner), since anchors do not make
 * sense when we are drawing vertices directly into the coordinate space.
