//
//  This module provides a scene graph node that supports wireframes.  The
//  primary use case is to have a node that outlines physics bodies.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.

/**
 * This is a scene graph node to represent a wireframe
 *
 * The wireframes are lines, but they can still be textured.  However, generally
 * you will only want to create a wireframe with the degenerate texture (to draw
 * a solid, colored line). Hence, none of the static constructors take a texture.
 * You are free to update the texture after creation, if you wish.
 *
 * The node shape is stored as polygon. The wireframe shape is determined by the
 * polygon traversal.  There are three options, defined in {@link poly2::Traversal}.
 *
 *     OPEN:     The traversal is in order, but does not close the ends.
 *
 *     CLOSED:   The traversal is in order, and closes the ends.
 *
 *     INTERIOR: The traverse will outline the default triangulation.
 *
 * The default is traversal is CLOSED.
 *
 * The wireframe can be textured (as lines can be textured).  The wireframe is
 * specified in image coordinates. Image coordinates are different from texture
 * coordinates. Their origin is at the bottom-left corner of the file, and each
 * pixel is one unit. This makes specifying to polygon more natural for
 * irregular shapes.
 *
 * This means that a wireframe with vertices (0,0), (width,0), (width,height),
 * and (0,height) would be the border of a sprite node. However, a wireframe
 * with vertices (0,0), (2*width,0), (2*width,2*height), and (0,2*height) would
 * tile the sprite texture (given the wrap settings) twice both horizontally
 * and vertically.
 *
 * The content size of this node is defined by the size (but not the offset)
 * of the bounding box.  The anchor point is relative to this content size.
 * The default anchor point in a TexturedNode is (0.5, 0.5).  This means that a
 * uniform translation of the polygon (in contrast to the node itself) will not
 * move the shape on the the screen.  Instead, it will just change the part of
 * the texture it uses.
 *
 * For example, suppose the texture has given width and height.  We have one
 * polygon with vertices (0,0), (width/2,0), (width/2,height/2), and (0,height/2).
 * We have another polygon with vertices (width/2,height/2), (width,height/2),
 * (width,height), and (width/2,height).  Both polygons would create a rectangle
 * of size (width/2,height/2). centered at the node position.  However, the
 * first would use the bottom left part of the texture, while the second would
 * use the top right.
 *
 * You can disable these features at any time by setting the attribute 
 * absolute to true.  Do this will place the polygon vertices in their 
 * absolute positions in Node space.  This will also disable anchor functions 
 * (setting the anchor as the bottom left corner), since anchors do not make 
 * sense when we are drawing vertices directly into the coordinate space.
