//
//  This module provides support for scroll pane that allows the user to
//  navigate a limited view of a larger backing view.  Classic examples
//  are a window that cannot show everything on the screen at once.
//
//  In many APIs, a scroll pane comes with sliders that allow you to
//  control the window position. However, while this is the natural
//  way to navigate a scroll pane in a desktop OS, it is not the natural
//  way to navigate it in a mobile device. In the latter case, gestures
//  are the preferred means of navigation.  As a result, this class is
//  not coupled with its navigation interface, and simply provides methods
//  for adjusting the position and orientation of the backing contents.
//
//  If you would like to have a more traditional navigation interface,
//  such as scroll bars, simply add slider object to the scene graph.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.

/**
 * This class is a node implements a scroll pane.
 *
 * A scroll pane is a node that contains a larger backing view. The scroll
 * pane uses an implicit scissor to guarantee that the user only sees what
 * is in the content bounds of this node (e.g the rectangle that starts at
 * (0,0) and has {@link #getContentSize()}). This allows you to create
 * internal windows that only show a portion of the backing contents.
 *
 * The contents of a scroll pane are its children. However, the scroll pane
 * also has the concept of {@link #getInterior}, representing the dimension
 * and location of the backing window. These bounds should be large enough
 * to contain all of the children, but this is not enforced. The significance
 * of the backing bounds is that the scroll pane will never go outside of
 * these bounds unless {@link #isConstrained} is true. Panning and zooming
 * will stop once it hits one of the boundary edges. This allows you to
 * prevent the user from going "out of bounds" when navigating the scroll pane.
 *
 * Scroll panes support layout managers just like any other scene graph node.
 * However, layout is performed with respect to the interior bounds and not
 * the content bounds.
 *
 * Scroll panes typically have scroll bars that allow you to navigate their
 * contents. While this makes sense on a desktop computer, it does not make
 * sense on a mobile device. On mobile devices, scroll panes are navigated
 * with gestures, such as panning, pinching, or rotating.
 *
 * As a result, this class does not contain any visual features for navigating
 * a scroll pane. It only has methods for controlling the position and
 * orientation of the the backing window. If you need visual interfaces
 * like a scroll bar, you can attach them separately to the scene graph.
 * Scroll bars are just instances of {@link Slider}.
 *
 * This scroll pane is generalized enough that it is not limited to panning.
 * It supports all of the core mobile navigation gestures: panning, zooming,
 * and spinning. These are controlled by the methods {@link #applyPan},
 * {@link #applyZoom}, and {@link #applySpin}. At first glance, these might
 * appear to be redundant with the transform methods {@link #setPosition},
 * {@link #setScale}, and {@link #setAngle}. But they are not.
 *
 * First of all, the transform methods are applied to this node while the
 * navigation methods are applied to the contents (i.e. the children). More
 * importantly, the navigation methods are applied to all of the children
 * uniformly. For example, when we call {@link #setScale} or {@link #setAngle}
 * on any child, it is with respect to the anchor of that child. However,
 * the navigation methods use the anchor of **this** node, which is often
 * reassigned by the gesture.
 *
 * These distinctions mean that it is quite tricky to implement navigation
 * features by manipulating the children directly. Indeed, this class was
 * created in reaction to the difficulties that developers had when they
 * added zoom features to their scrolling windows. The classic example of
 * this is a large game map that the user navigates by panning, zooming in,
 * and zooming out.
 *
 * The trickiest feature of the scroll pane is rotation (spinning). Because
 * the backing bounds are a rectangle, and pane does not show anything
 * outside of these bounds, the edges can catch on the visible bounds and
 * block the rotation. If this is a problem you should either ignore spin
 * input in your application or set {@link #setConstrained} to false. However,
 * the latter will mean that the user can navigate outside of the backing area.
