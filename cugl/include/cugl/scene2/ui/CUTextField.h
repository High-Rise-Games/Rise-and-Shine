//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  This module provides support for a single line text field. It is useful
//  for providing input forms for your application, such as saved games or
//  player settings.  Because it is only a single line, it is a subclass of
//  label.  A multiline text input would be a TextArea, and that is not
//  currently supported.
//
//  To make use of a TextField, BOTH Keyboard and TextInput input devices
//  must be activated.  In particular, TextInput allows the support of
//  virtual keyboards on mobile devices.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.

/**
 * This class represents a single line text field.
 *
 * A text field is a subclass of {link Label} that permits the user to edit
 * it when focused (e.g. when it is selected to receive keyboard events).
 * A focused field displays a blinking cursor with the current edit position.
 * There is no cursor displayed when the field does not have focus.
 *
 * The textfield can track its own state, via the {@link #activate()} method,
 * relieving you of having to manually the keyboard.  In addition, it also
 * reponds to mouse/touch input, allowing you to reposition the cursor and
 * either focus or unfocus the text field. However, the appropriate input
 * devices must be active before you can activate the text fields, as it needs
 * to attach internal listeners.  These devices include {@link TextInput},
 * {@link Keyboard}, and either {@link Mouse} or {@link Touchscreen}.
 *
 * The text field supports two category of listeners.  The first tracks any
 * changes to the text.  The second only updates when the field loses focus,
 * such as when the user presses return.
 *
 * As with {@link Label}, a text field is able to support multiline text. In
 * addition, the user can navigate this text with the arrow keys or by using
 * the mouse/touch to reposition the cursor.  With that said, this class is
 * is designed for small-to-medium sized segments of text. It is not designed
 * to be an all-purpose text editor for managing large strings. That is
 * because every single edit (no matter how small) will reformat the entire
 * text.
