//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  This module provides a scene graph node that displays formatted text. It
//  is backed by a text layout object and therefore can support multi-line
//  text.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.

 * This class is a node the represents formatted text on rectangular background.
 *
 * By default, the content size is just large enough to render the text given.
 * If you reset the content size to larger than the what the text needs, the
 * the text is placed in the label according to the text bounds. If you reset
 * it to smaller, the text may be cut off in rendering.
 *
 * If the background color is not clear, then the label will have a colored
 * backing rectangle.  The rectangle will extended from the origin to the
 * content size in Node space.
 *
 * The text itself is formatted using a {@link TextLayout}. This text layout
 * breaks the text into multiple lines as needed, though by default, a label
 * only breaks lines at explicit newlines. The text layout aligns the lines
 * of text with each other. But it also positions the text against the
 * background rectangle as well. See {@link #getHorizontalAlignment} and
 * {@link #getVerticalAlignment} for more information.
 *
 * To display the text, you need a {@link Font}. The label assumes that the
 * font has an atlas, either through a pre-built atlas, or by setting the
 * attribute {@link Font#setAtlasFallback} to true.  If the font does not
 * have an atlas, or characters are missing from the atlas, then those
 * glyphs will not be displayed. It is generally recommended that you use
 * a prebuilt atlas, as fallback atlases introduce significant time and
 * memory overhead.
