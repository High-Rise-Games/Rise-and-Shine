//  CUMultimodalButton.cpp
//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  This module provides support for a simple button group. It is made of
//  a list of toggle buttons, of which at most one can be selected at once.
//  The button group has its own listener, and the individual buttons can
//  have their own as will if needed.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.
