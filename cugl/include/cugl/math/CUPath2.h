//
//  This module provides a class that represents a flattened polyline (e.g. a
//  1-dimensional, piecewise linear path). In previous iterations of CUGL, this
//  functionality was included as part of the Poly2 class. However, as we added
//  more computational geometry features to the engine, this became untenable.
//  So we elected to separate the two.
//
//  Paths can be converted into Poly2 objects by using either a triangulator or
//  an extruder.  In the case of triangulation, the interior of a Path is always
//  determined by the left (counter-clockwise) sides.  Hence the boundary of
//  of a shape should be a counter-clockwise path, while any hole should be a
//  clockwise path.
//
//  Because math objects are intended to be on the stack, we do not provide
//  any shared pointer support in this class.

/**
 * Class to represent a flattened polyline.
 *
 * This class is intended to represent any continuous polyline.  While it may be
 * either open or closed, it should not have any gaps between vertices.  If you
 * need a path with gaps, that should be represented by multiple Path2 objects.
 *
 * It is possible to draw a path object directly to a {@link SpriteBatch}. However,
 * in most applications you will want to convert a path object to a {@link Poly2}
 * for width and texturing.  In particular, you will often want to either extrude
 * (give stroke width) or triangulate (fill) a path.
 *
 * We have provided several factories for converting a path to a {@link Poly2}.
 * These factories allow for delegating index computation to a separate thread,
 * if it takes too long. These factories are as follows:
 *
 * {@link EarclipTriangulator}: This is a simple earclipping-triangulator for
 * tesselating paths into polygons. It supports holes, but does not support
 * self-intersections. While it produces better (e.g. less thin) triangles
 * than MonotoneTriangulator, this comes at a cost. This triangulator has
 * worst case O(n^2).  With that said, it has low overhead and so is very
 * efficient on small polygons.
 *
 * {@link DelaunayTriangulator}: This is a Delaunay Triangular that gives a
 * more uniform triangulation in accordance to the Vornoi diagram. This
 * triangulator uses an advancing-front algorithm that is the fastest in
 * practice (though worst case O(n log n) is not guaranteed).  However, it
 * has a lot of overhead that is unnecessary for small polygons. As with
 * EarclipTriangulator, it supports holes, but does not support
 * self-intersections.
 *
 * {@link PathFactory}: This is a tool is used to generate several basic
 * path shapes, such as rounded rectangles or arcs. It also allows you
 * construct wireframe traversals of polygon meshes.
 *
 * {@link SimpleExtruder}: This is a tool can take a path and convert it
 * into a solid polygon. This solid polygon is the same as the path, except
 * that the path now has a width and a mitre at the joints.  This algorithm
 * is quite fast, but the resulting polygon may overlap itself. This is ideal
 * for strokes that only need to be drawn and do not need accurate geometric
 * information.
 *
 * {@link ComplexExtruder}: Like {@link SimpleExtruder}, this is a tool can
 * take a path polygon and convert it into a solid polygon. However it is
 * much more powerful and guarantees that the resulting polygon has no
 * overlaps. Unforunately, it is extremely slow (in the 10s of milliseconds)
 * and is unsuitable for calcuations at framerate.
