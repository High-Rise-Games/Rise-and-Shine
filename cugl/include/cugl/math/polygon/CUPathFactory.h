//
//  CUPathFactory.h
//
//  This module provides a convenient way to generate simple paths, like lines
//  or circles. It is lighter weight than the other factory classes because it
//  does not separate the calculation step from the materialization step. That
//  is because all of its calculations are very short and do not need to be
//  factored into a separate thread.
//
//  This class differs from PolyFactory in that it only produces paths, and
//  not pre-triangulated polygons.
//
//  Because math objects are intended to be on the stack, we do not provide
//  any shared pointer support in this class.
//
//  This implementation is largely inspired by the LibGDX implementation from
//  Nicolas Gramlich, Eric Spits, Thomas Cate, and Nathan Sweet.

/**
 * This class is a factory for generating common {@link Path2} objects.
 *
 * Most of the time that we create a path, we are using it to approximate a common
 * shape, like a circle, or a rounded rectangle.  Instead of embedding all of this
 * functionality into {@link Path2} (which already has enough to do on its own), we
 * have factored this out into a a separate factory class. This factory can generate
 * new path or reset existing ones (conserving memory).
 *
 * Note that this factory only generates path, and does not create {@link Path2}
 * objects. It is intended for shapes that will be drawn as lines or extruded
 * later. If you want a solid (e.g. triangulated) shape, use {@link PolyFactory}
 * instead.
