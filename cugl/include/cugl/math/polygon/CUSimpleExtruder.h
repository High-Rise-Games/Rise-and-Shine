//  This module is a factory for extruding a path polgyon into a stroke with
//  width. It has support for joints and end caps.
//
//  The code in this factory is inspired from the extrusion code in NanoVG
//  Mikko Mononen (memon@inside.org). Unlike the extrusion code in previous
//  iterations of CUGL, this extrusion guarantees that the triangle mesh is
//  "in order" (instead of back-filling joints after the segments) while
//  still guaranteeing fast, linear performance.
//
//  This code has been heavily profiled and optimized to guarantee sub-millisecond
//  performance for most applications.  However, extruded paths that are the
//  result of drawing should always be passed through a {@link PathSmoother}
//  first for best performance.
//
//  Since math objects are intended to be on the stack, we do not provide
//  any shared pointer support in this class.

/**
 * This class is a factory for extruding paths into a solid polygon.
 *
 * An extrusion of a path is a polygon that follows the path but gives it
 * width. Hence it takes a path and turns it into a solid shape. This is
 * more complicated than simply triangulating the original path. The new
 * polygon has more vertices, depending on the choice of joint (shape at
 * the corners) and cap (shape at the end).
 *
 * This class is significantly faster than {@link ComplexExtruder}.  It
 * guarantees sub-millisecond performance for most applications (even
 * thousands of vertices), and so it can be used at framerate. However,
 * this speed comes at significant cost percision. In particular, the
 * {@link Poly2} object created has overlapping triangles, as the algorithm
 * makes no effort to detecting crossing or overlaps. While this is fine
 * for drawing the extrusion with a {@link scene2::PathNode}, it is not accurate
 * for high precision geometry computations. In particular, it will not
 * provide an accurate picture of the boundary. For a geometrically accurate
 * extrusion, you should use {@link ComplexExtruder} instead.
 *
 * One advantage of this tool has over {@link ComplexExtruder} is that it
 * keeps track of the left and right sides of the extrusion at all times
 * (which is only possible since overlaps are preserved). This information
 * can be abstracted and used to properly fade or texture the stroke.
 *
 * As with all factories, the methods are broken up into three phases:
 * initialization, calculation, and materialization. To use the factory,
 * you first set the data (in this case a set of vertices or {@link Path2}
 * object) with the initialization methods. You then call the calculation
 * method. Finally, you use the materialization methods to access the data
 * in several different ways.
 *
 * This division allows us to support multithreaded calculation if the data
 * generation takes too long.  However, note that this factory is not thread
 * safe in that you cannot access data while it is still in mid-calculation.
 *
 * CREDITS: This code heavily inspired by NanoVG by Mikko Mononen
 * (memon@inside.org), and the bulk of the algorithm is taken from that code.
 * However it is has been altered and optimized according to extensive profiling.
