/**
 * This class is a factory for extruding wireframe paths into a solid path.
 *
 * An extrusion of a path is a polygon that follows the path but gives it
 * width. Hence it takes a path and turns it into a solid shape. This is
 * more complicated than simply triangulating the original path. The new
 * polygon has more vertices, depending on the choice of joint (shape at
 * the corners) and cap (shape at the end).
 *
 * This class is significantly more accurate than {@link SimpleExtruder}.
 * The extruded shape has no overlapping triangles and is safe to use with
 * transparency. However, this comes at massive cost in speed. Even a
 * simple line can take a full millisecond to compute, and more complicated
 * paths will significantly affect frame rate. If you need to extrude a
 * path at framerate, you should use {@link SimpleExtruder} instead, and
 * pre-render to a texture if you need transparency.
 *
 * As with all factories, the methods are broken up into three phases:
 * initialization, calculation, and materialization. To use the factory,
 * you first set the data (in this case a set of vertices or {@link Path2}
 * object) with the initialization methods. You then call the calculation
 * method. Finally, you use the materialization methods to access the data
 * in several different ways.
 *
 * This division allows us to support multithreaded calculation if the data
 * generation takes too long.  However, note that this factory is not thread
 * safe in that you cannot access data while it is still in mid-calculation.
