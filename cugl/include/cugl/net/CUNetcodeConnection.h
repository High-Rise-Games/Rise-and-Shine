//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  This module is part of a Web RTC implementation of the classic CUGL networking 
//  library. That library provided connected to a custom game server for matchmaking, 
//  and used reliable UDP communication. This version replaces the matchmaking server 
//  with a web socket, and uses web socket data channels for communication.
//
//  This module specifically supports the top level connection classes. These are
//  the only part of the netcode communication classes that the user will interface
//  with directly.
//
//  This module is inspired by the original networking classes defined by onewordstudios:
//  - Demi Chang
//  - Aashna Saxena
//  - Sam Sorenson
//  - Michael Xing
//  - Jeffrey Yao
//  - Wendy Zhang
//  https://onewordstudios.com/
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.
//
//  Note, however, that it is never safe to put this particular object on the stack.
//  therefore, everything except for the static constructors are private.

/**
 * This class to supports a connection to other players with a peer-to-peer interface.
 *
 * The premise of this class is to make networking as simple as possible. Simply call
 * {@link #broadcast} with a byte vector, and then all others will receive it when they 
 * call {@link #receive}.  You can use the classes {@link NetcodeSerializer} and 
 * {@link NetcodeDeserializer} to handle more complex types.
 *
 * This class maintains a networked game using a peer-to-peer connections. One player is
 * designated as "host", but this is purely an organizational concept. The host monitors
 * the other players, allowing them join. But once the game starts, all communication is
 * peer-to-peer and the question of authority are determined by the application layer.
 *
 * You can use this as a true client-server by replacing all calls to {@link #broadcast}
 * with calls to {@link #sendTo}. That way clients can send to the host and the host can
 * broadcast its responses.
 *
 * Using this class requires an external lobby websocket server to enable Web RTC data
 * channels. This server does not handle actual game data. In only connects that players,
 * an occasionally monitors for disconnects requiring host migration. This reduces
 * server costs significantly. We will provide you a Docker package for a lobby server
 * later in the semester.
 *
 * This class supports optional host migration should the host be lost. Upon loss of
 * the host, each surviving client will receive an invocation of the callback function
 * {@link #onPromotion}. if the callback exists and returns true, that client will
 * become a candidate to be the new host. If more than one client is a candidate, the
 * lobby will chose the first available. If any client disconnects during the migration
 * process, host migration will fail. See {@link #onPromotion} for more details.
 *
 * It is completely unsafe for network connections to be used on the stack. For that
 * reason, this class hides the initialization methods (and the constructors create
 * uninitialized connections). You are forced to go through the static allocator
 * {@link #alloc} to create instances of this class.
