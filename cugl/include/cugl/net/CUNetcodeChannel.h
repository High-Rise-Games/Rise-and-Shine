//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  This module is part of a Web RTC implementation of the classic CUGL networking 
//  library. That library provided connected to a custom game server for matchmaking, 
//  and used reliable UDP communication. This version replaces the matchmaking server 
//  with a web socket, and uses web socket data channels for communication.
//
//  This module specifically supports the data channels between the various devices
//  in the game. It is possible for a device to support multiple communication channels,
//  even with respect to just one other device on the network.
//
//  This module is inspired by the original networking classes defined by onewordstudios:
//  - Demi Chang
//  - Aashna Saxena
//  - Sam Sorenson
//  - Michael Xing
//  - Jeffrey Yao
//  - Wendy Zhang

//
//  This class has no public allocators. All allocation takes place in either NetcodePeer
//  or NetcodeConnection.
