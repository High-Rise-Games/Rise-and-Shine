//
//  This module provides the global initialization (and tear-down) for CUGL network
//  communications. It must be activated before you can access any network connections.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.

 * the singleton with the {@link #start} and {@link #stop} methods appropriately.
 *
 * While it is safe to construct internet addresses without this subsystem, you must
 * initialize this system before using {@link NetcodeConnection}.
