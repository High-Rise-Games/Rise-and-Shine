//  This module provides support for serializing and deserializing information
//  across the network. The class NetcodeConnection can only handle byte arrays.
//  These classes allow you to transfer much more complex data into these byte
//  arrays.
//
//  These classes do not QUITE use our standard shared-pointer architecture. That
//  is because there is no non-trivial constructor patterns and so an init method
//  is not necessary. However, we do still include an alloc method for creating
//  shared pointers.
