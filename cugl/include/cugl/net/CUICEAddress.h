/**
 * This class represents an ICE internet address (with a username and password).
 *
 * An ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) server is used to provide NAT
 * punchthrough services. This allows players to connect across different networks,
 * or even in the same network when the game lobby is located in another network.
 *
 * ICE servers are categorized as STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) or
 * TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) servers. STUN servers use simple UDP
 * rerouting to help players find each other. While they are successful on most
 * networks, they can be blocked by aggressive firewalls. TURN servers act as
 * a communication middleman for getting around firewalls.
 *
 * Because STUN servers perform simple rerouting, they are freely available and
 * do not require log-in credentials. Google has several available, such as
 * "stun.l.google.com:19302" or "stun4.l.google.com:19302".
 *
 * TURN servers must actively communicate in a session, and therefore are unlikely
 * to be free.  Most require user accounts and passwords.  But the issue is entirely
 * the compute cost. CUGL is compatible with open source TURN servers such as Violet:
 *
 *   https://github.com/paullouisageneau/violet
 *
 * For this reason, this class will always associate a username and password with
 * a TURN server.
 *
 * Like its parent class, this class is effectively a simple struct. All attributes are
 * publicly available and we do not use the standard CUGL shared pointer architecture.
 * Internet addresses are designed to be use on the stack, though you can combine them
 * with share pointers if you wish.
