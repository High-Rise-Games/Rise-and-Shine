 * A core gesture contains three bits of information: the position
 * of the fingers (computed as the average), the distance spread
 * between the fingers, and the current angle of the line between
 * the two fingers. All three values are continually updated
 * regardless of the gesture type.
 *
 * The gesture type is initially {@link CoreGestureType#NONE},

 * passed. The threshold limits are defined in {@link CoreGesture}.
 *
 * The value of pan and pinch events is typically measured in pixels,
 * as it is assumed that the touch device is also the display (e.g.
 * most mobile devices). However, in situtations where that is not
 * the case (e.g. MacBook trackpad), the values will be measured
 * assuming the touch device is a unit square. In that case all pan
 * positions are (0,0) to (1,1), while all pinch spreads are 0 to

/**
 * This class is an input device recognizing the core two-finger gestures.
 *
 * There are three code two-finger gestures: pan (for translating a scene),
 * pinch (for zooming in or out of a scene), and spin (for rotating a scene).
 * We do have gesture inputs for each type: {@link PanGesture},
 * {@link PinchGesture}, and {@link SpinGesture}.  However, the problem with
 * using these inputs individually is that this would allow the user to
 * perform these gestures simultaneously. This is typically not what you
 * want, as it could cause the scene to rotate unstably while the user tries
 * to pan or pinch.
 *
 * Instead, most applications attempt to detect which of three gestures the
 * user is trying to perform and chose the best one. Once the gesture is
 * type is detected, the other gesture types will not be recognized until
 * the gesture is completed. Doing this requires combining all gestures into
 * a single input device, which is exactly what this class does.
 *
 * In order to destinguish between the three gesture types, this device has
 * several threshold factors that can be defined by the user.  For example,
 * a {@link CoreGestureType::PAN} is recognized when the cumulative distance
 * exceeds the {@link #getPanThreshold}. A {@link CoreGestureType::PINCH}
 * is recognized when the change in pinch distance exceeds
 * {@link #getPinchThreshold}. And a {@link CoreGestureType::SPIN} is
 * recognized when the change in angle exceeds {@link #getSpinThreshold}.
 * The priority is to recognize a pan before a pinch and a pinch before a
 * spin.
 *
 * By default all pan and pinch information will scale with the display,
 * and be measured in pixels. However, this assumes that the touch input
 * and the display are one and the same (e.g. most mobile devices). However,
 * there are some touch devices, like the MacBook trackpad, that cannot be
 * measure in pixels. For those types of devices, any pan or pinch will be
 * normalized to a unit square, where the top left corner of the touch
 * device is (0,0) and the lower right is (1,1).
