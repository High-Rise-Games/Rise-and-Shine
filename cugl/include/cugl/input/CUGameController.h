/**
 * This class is a reference to single game controller.
 *
 * This class is built on top of the SDL GameController interface. This allows
 * the developer to use a uniform input independent of the controller input
 * type (i.e. D-input vs Xinput). This API is slightly more restrictive than
 * the SDL joystick interface, in that it does not have support for hats
 * or track balls). Instead, the types of input are limited to the following:
 *
 *  - Axes: Analogue joysticks and triggers
 *  - Buttons: On/off input
 *
 * In this interface, D-Pads are treated as buttons and not hats. However, we
 * do abstract out a D-Pad interface to replicate joystick hat functionality.
 *
 * Note that SDL game controllers also support sensors (accelerometers) and
 * touch pads (such as the PS4 touchpad). None of that is support currently.
 *
 * The advantage of the SDL game controller API is that layout is uniform. All
 * controllers have buttons and axes in the same place. Our API uses the XBox
 * names of buttons (A, B, X, Y) instead of the Playstation names, as they are
 * easier to reference.
 *
 * There should only be one instance of a specific controller at any given
 * time. In addition, controllers can be connected and removed while the
 * application is running. For that reason, this class does not allow you
 * to allocate an game controller object. Instead, you must access each
 * game controller through the {@link GameControllerInput} interface.
