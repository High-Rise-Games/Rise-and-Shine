//  This class provides basic support for the standard two-finger gestures provided
//  by all mobile platforms: pan, pinch, and spin.  While there is native code for
//  managing these on each platform, this device ensures that the gestures are processed
//  in a consistent way across all platforms.
//  This class is a singleton and should never be allocated directly.  It
//  should only be accessed via the Input dispatcher.
