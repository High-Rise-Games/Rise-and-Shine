//
//  CUFont.cpp
//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  This module provides a robust font asset with atlas support.  Unlike other
//  systems we decided to merge fonts and font atlases because it helps with
//  asset management.
//
//  This module makes heavy use of the cross-platform UTF8 utilities by
//  Nemanja Trifunovic ( https://github.com/nemtrif/utfcpp ).
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.

/**
 * Creates a quad outline of this character and stores it in mesh
 *
 * This method will append the vertices to the provided mesh and update
 * the indices to include these new vertices. Once the quad is generated,
 * the offset will be adjusted to contain the next place to render a
 * character.
 *
 * The dimensionons of the quad are determined by the metrics. Hence this
 * is a bounding box of the glyph, but it does not align with the actual
 * vertices of a rendered glyph.  That is, this quad outline is guaranteed
 * to fit within the bounds of a rendered glyph, but not necessarly to
 * match it.
 *
 * The quad is adjusted so that all of the vertices fit in the provided
 * rectangle.  This may mean that no quad is generated at all.
 *
 * @param thechar   The character to convert to render data
 * @param offset    The (unkerned) starting position of the quad
 * @param mesh      The mesh to store the vertices
