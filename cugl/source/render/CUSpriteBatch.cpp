//  CUSpriteBatch.cpp
//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  This module provides one-stop shopping for basic 2d graphics in OpenGL.  Despite 
//  the name, it is also capable of drawing solid shapes, as well as wireframes.
//  It also has support for color gradients and (rotational) scissor masks.
//
//  While it is possible to swap out the shader for this class, the shader is
//  very peculiar in how it uses uniforms.  You should study SpriteShader.frag
//  and SpriteShader.vert before making any shader changes to this class.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.
