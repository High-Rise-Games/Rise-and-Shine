//
//  CUSpline2.cpp
//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  This module provides a class that represents a spline of cubic beziers. A
//  bezier spline is just a sequence of beziers joined together, so that the end
//  of one is the beginning of the other. Cubic beziers have four control points,
//  two for the vertex anchors and two for their tangents.
//
//  This class has been purposefully kept lightweight.  If you want to draw a
//  Spline2, you will need to allocate a Path2 value for the spline using
//  the factory SplinePather.  We have to turn shapes into paths or polygons
//  to draw them anyway, and this allows us to do all of the cool things we can
//  already do with paths, like extrude them or create wireframes.
//
//  Because math objects are intended to be on the stack, we do not provide
//  any shared pointer support in this class.
