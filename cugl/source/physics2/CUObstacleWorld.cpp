//
//  CUObstacleWorld.cpp
//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  This module provides a wrapper to Box2d that for use with CUGL obstacle
//  heirarchy.  Obstacles provide a simple and direct way to create physics
//  objects that does not require the multi-step approach of Box2D.  It also
//  supports shared pointers for simply memory management.
//
//  However, this class is not as flexible as Box2D.  Therefore, it may be
//  necessary to access Box2D directly at times.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.
