//
//  This module is an extension to ObstacleWorld from the physics2 package to
//  enable networked physics. Its primary purpose is id management for pointer
//  swizzling obstacles and joints.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.
