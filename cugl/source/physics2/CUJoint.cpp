//  Like the Obstacle class, this is class is used to introduce some additional
//  coupling into Box2d. In this case, it couples active joints with their
//  definitions. This makes it a little easier to turn joints on and off, and
//  to share them across physics worlds. The latter is necessary for networking.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.
