//
//  CUAudioSample.cpp
//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  This module provides the base class for representing an audio sample, or
//  a file with prerecorded audio. An audio sample is not a node in the audio
//  graph.  Instead, a sample is provided to an AudioPlayer for playback.
//  Multiple AudioPlayers can share the same sample, allowing copies of the
//  sound to be played simultaneously
//
//  This module provides support for both in-memory audio samples and streaming
//  audio. The former is ideal for sound effects, but not long-playing music.
//  The latter introduces some latency and is only ideal for long-playing music.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.
