This library is a C++ cross platform game library for macOS, iOS, Windows, and Android. Its primary focus is the mobile platforms iOS and Android.

Using CUGL
----------

The folder `cugl` is actually a python application to build CUGL projects. Run it on a CUGL project to create the build files. For example, to create the build files for 
`HelloCUGL`, simply type

	python cugl demos/HelloCUGL
	
The build files will be located in `HelloCUGL/build`. 

See the `README.md` in `cugl` for more information on how to set up a CUGL project.  The `demos` provide several examples as well.
