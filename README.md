Technical Prototype for Group 1.

To run: use "python cugl ." in the top directory and then build.
Works on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Andriod devices. 

In multiplayer, you can move onto the other opponent's board if you go to the edge
of the building and click the button on the bottom right corner. In this
state, you can drag your player character in order throw dirt
at your opponent. To go back to your board, simply press the button 
again. 

Note: We have a modified version of the latest release of CUGL. 
Phillip Martin had modified the code in CUGL to fix a bug in retrieving doubles from JSONs.
