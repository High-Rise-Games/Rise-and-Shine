Closed Beta release for Group 1.

To run on Mac, use "python cugl ." and run the game on Xcode for the IOS target.

To run on IOS, download the game via Firebase from https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/7c797997a163676e or https://appdistribution.firebase.google.com/testerapps/1:396419953093:ios:70056b2236e88e4f5adbac/releases/6e06jn422igb0?utm_source=firebase-console. 

To run on Android, download the APK from firebase as well, link TBA. 

Known Issue: if two players select the same character, their progress bar will be combined, so there will only be one progress bar for each player.

Note: We have a modified version of the latest release of CUGL. 
Phillip Martin had modified the code in CUGL to fix a bug in retrieving doubles from JSONs.
