To run on IOS and Mac, use "python cugl ." and run the game on Xcode for the designated platform of either IOS or Mac.

In multiplayer, you can move onto the other opponent's board if you go to the edge
of the building and swipe to move off the building. In this
state, you can drag your player character in order throw dirt
at your opponent. To go back to your board, simply press the black circle button.

Note: We have a modified version of the latest release of CUGL. 
Phillip Martin had modified the code in CUGL to fix a bug in retrieving doubles from JSONs.
