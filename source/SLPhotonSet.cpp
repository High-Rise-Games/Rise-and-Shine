//  PhotonSet.cpp
//
//  In the intro class we implemented the photons as a "particle system". That
//  is because memory was a tricky resource in Java. While we obviously need
//  to worry about memory in C++, we don't need to use anything as advanced as
//  free lists just yet.  Smart pointers will take care of us!
//
//  With that said, the design of this class is entirely up to you.  Follow
//  the instructions carefully.
