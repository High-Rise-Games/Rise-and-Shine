//  Unless you are making a point-and-click adventure game, every single
//  game is going to need some sort of collision detection.  In a later
//  lab, we will see how to do this with a physics engine. For now, we use
//  custom physics.
//
//  You might ask why we need this file when we have Box2d. That is because
//  we are trying to make this code as close to that of 3152 as possible. At
//  this point in the semester of 3152, we had not covered Box2d.
//
//  As you work on this class, there is an interesting thing to note.  The
//  constructor and the initializer are SEPARATE.  That is because the
//  constructor is called as soon as the object is created and that happens
//  BEFORE we know the window size.
