//  This class tracks all of the state (position, velocity, rotation) of a
//  single ship. In order to obey the separation of the model-view-controller
//  pattern, controller specific code (such as reading the keyboard) is not
//  present in this class.
//
//  With that said, you will notice several elements that look like they are
//  part of the view, namely the texture and sound.  But this is the texture
//  and sound DATA.  The actual view are the sprite batch and audio engine,
//  respectively, that use this data to provide feedback on the screen.
